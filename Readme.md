# Image Compression with K-Means🗜️
The program uses K-Means, a Machine Learning Clustering algorithm, to cluster all the colours in an image into desired number of clusters and replace the RGB value of every pixel with the RGB value of their respective cluster center and thus reducing the size of the image.

# Interactive Image Compression üóúÔ∏è

The program uses K-Means, a Machine Learning Clustering algorithm, to cluster all the colours in an image into desired number of clusters and replace the RGB value of every pixel with the RGB value of their respective cluster center and thus reducing the size of the image.

- The image can be selected from the dropdown menu (4 included by default)
- The slider can be used to select the number of clusters tobe used for compression (16 is default)
- The compressed image will be automatically saved in the root of the main folder
- The size of original and compressed image is also displayed at the end (in bytes)
